we use kaggle because it is easy to pull the dataset without needing to install it on our own  ⭐ᕙ(๑>؂•̀๑)
my team were thinking to combine the Novel summarization research that we were working on, by using text dataset that we obtained from implementing Speech To Text. in the end we couldn't combine it because the dataset that is required will be very very hugeee in order to make the overall accuracy to be good to go... 😩

Well back to topic in STT (Speech To Text) we use Wav2Vec 2.0 because it has achieved good accurate results of 9% WER (Word Error Rate) what it mean is out of 100 words 9 of those is incorrect/error. but sadly it still needs further fine-tuning due to it's inability to generate named word.
